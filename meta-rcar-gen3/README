meta-rcar-gen3
==============

This layer provides that evaluation board is mounted ARM SoCs of Renesas
Electronics, called the R-Car Generation 3. Currently, this supports
board and the SoCs of the following:
     - Board: Salvator-X   / SoC: R8A7795 (R-Car H3)

Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

    URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
    layers: meta, meta-yocto, meta-yocto-bsp
    branch: jethro

    URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-renesas

Build Instructions
==================

The following instructions require a Poky installation (or equivalent).

Initialize a build using the 'oe-init-build-env' script in Poky. e.g.:

    $ source poky/oe-init-build-env

After that, initialized configure bblayers.conf by adding meta-rcar-gen3 layer. e.g.:

    BBLAYERS ?= " \
        <path to layer>/poky/meta \
        <path to layer>/poky/meta-yocto \
        <path to layer>/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
        <path to layer>/meta-renesas/meta-rcar-gen3 \
        <path to layer>/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
    "

To build a specific target BSP, configure the associated machine in local.conf:

    MACHINE ??= "<supported board name>"

Must change the package class to ipk files in local.conf:

    PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_ipk"

Must append the 32-bit application to the image in local.conf.
At least one 32-bit app have to be installed to run the multilib image.e.g.:

    IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " lib32-coreutils"

Configure for systemd init in local.conf:

    DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " systemd"
    VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"

Build the target file system image using bitbake:

    $ bitbake core-image-minimal

After completing the images for the target machine will be available in the output
directory 'tmp/deploy/images/<supported board name>'.

Images generated:
    * Image (generic Linux Kernel binary image file)
    * Image-<machine name>.dtb (DTB for target machine)
    * core-image-minimal-<machine name>.tar.bz2 (rootfs tar+bzip2)
    * core-image-minimal-<machine name>.ext4  (rootfs ext4 format)
    * core-image-minimal-<machine name>.cpio.gz (rootfs cpio+gz format)

Build Instructions for SDK
==========================
This may be changed in the near feature. These instructions are tentative.

Should define the staticdev in SDK image feature for installing the static libs
to SDK in local.conf.

    SDKIMAGE_FEATURES_append = " staticdev-pkgs"

Use bitbake -c populate_sdk for generating the toolchain SDK:
For 64-bit target SDK (aarch64):

    $ bitbake core-image-minimal -c populate_sdk

For 32-bit target SDK (aarch32):

    $ bitbake lib32-core-image-minimal -c populate_sdk

The SDK can be found in the output directory 'tmp/deploy/sdk'
    * poky-glibc-x86_64-core-image-minimal-aarch64-toolchain-1.8.sh

Usage of toolchain SDK:
Install the SDK to the default: /opt/poky/1.8
For 64-bit target SDK:

    $ sh poky-glibc-x86_64-core-image-minimal-aarch64-toolchain-1.8.sh

For 32-bit target SDK:

    $ sh poky-glibc-x86_64-lib32-core-image-minimal-aarch64-toolchain-1.8.sh

For 64-bit application use environment script in /opt/poky/1.8

    $ source /opt/poky/1.8/environment-setup-aarch64-poky-linux

For 32-bit application use environment script in /opt/poky/1.8

    $ source /opt/poky/1.8/environment-setup-armv7ahf-vfp-pokymllib32-linux-gnueabi

Restrictions
============

As the information from community, Poky doesn't well support toolchain SDK for multilib.
This release has just been tested with core-image-minimal target only.
Please be Noted that:
- The poky-glibc-x86_64-core-image-minimal-aarch64-toolchain-1.8.sh (1) only supports for 64-bit application.
  We can't compile the 32 bit apps with (1). Please don't source the environment-setup-armv7ahf-vfp-pokymllib32-linux-gnueabi.
- The poky-glibc-x86_64-lib32-core-image-minimal-aarch64-toolchain-1.8.sh (2) only supports for 32-bit application.
  We can't compile the 64 bit apps with (2). Please don't source the environment-setup-aarch64-poky-linux.
- In case, there is necessary to use both aarch64/aarch32 SDK. Please install them into different directories.
