meta-rcar-gen3
==============

This layer provides that evaluation board is mounted ARM SoCs of Renesas
Electronics, called the R-Car Generation 3. Currently, this supports
board and the SoCs of the following:
     - Board: Salvator-X   / SoC: R8A7795 (R-Car H3)

Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

    URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
    layers: meta, meta-yocto, meta-yocto-bsp
    branch: fido

    URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-renesas
    layers: meta-rcar-gen3
    branch: fido

Build Instructions
==================

The following instructions require a Poky installation (or equivalent).

Initialize a build using the 'oe-init-build-env' script in Poky. e.g.:

    $ source poky/oe-init-build-env

After that, initialized configure bblayers.conf by adding meta-rcar-gen3 layer. e.g.:

    BBLAYERS ?= " \
        <path to layer>/poky/meta \
        <path to layer>/poky/meta-yocto \
        <path to layer>/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
        <path to layer>/meta-renesas/meta-rcar-gen3 \
    "

To build a specific target BSP, configure the associated machine in local.conf:

    MACHINE ??= "<supported board name>"

Must change the package class to ipk files in local.conf:

    PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_ipk"

Must append the 32-bit application to the image in local.conf.
At least one 32-bit app have to be installed to run the multilib image.e.g.:

    IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " lib32-coreutils"

Configure for systemd init in local.conf:

    DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " systemd"
    VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"

Build the target file system image using bitbake:

    $ bitbake core-image-minimal

After completing the images for the target machine will be available in the output
directory 'tmp/deploy/images/<supported board name>'.

Images generated:
    * Image (generic Linux Kernel binary image file)
    * Image-<machine name>.dtb (DTB for target machine)
    * core-image-minimal-<machine name>.tar.bz2 (rootfs tar+bzip2)
    * core-image-minimal-<machine name>.ext4  (rootfs ext4 format)
    * core-image-minimal-<machine name>.cpio.gz (rootfs cpio+gz format)
