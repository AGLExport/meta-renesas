This layer depends on:

	URI: git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake

	URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
	layers: meta

Build Instructions
==================

The following instructions require a Poky installation (or equivalent).

Initialize a build using the 'oe-init-build-env' script in Poky. Once
initialized configure bblayers.conf by adding the 'meta-renesas' and 'meta-BOARD' layer. 
e.g.:

	BBLAYERS ?= " \
		<path to layer>/oe-core/meta \
		<path to layer>/meta-renesas \
		<path to layer>/meta-lager \
		"

To build a specific target BSP configure the associated machine in local.conf:

	MACHINE ?= "lager"

Build the target file system image using bitbake:

	$ bitbake core-image-minimal

Once complete the images for the target machine will be available in the output
directory 'tmp/deploy/images'.


Install packages
================
To install the package, meta-renesas have flag of some unique.

USE_GSTREAMER_0_10:
	If you want to use gstreamer 0.10, plaese set USE_GSTREAMER_0_10="1" in conf/local.conf.
	When enabled, the package of some of the gstrermer 0.10 will be installed in the boot image.

USE_GSTREAMER_1_00:
	If you want to use gstreamer 1.xx, plaese set USE_GSTREAMER_1_00="1" in conf/local.conf.
	When enabled, the package of some of the gstrermer 1.xx will be installed in the boot image.
